![alt text](LOGO.png "Cascade: A JIT Compiler for Verilog")

FPGAs can exceed the performance of general-purpose CPUs by several orders of magnitude and offer dramatically lower cost and time to market than ASICs. While the benefits are substantial, programming an FPGA can be an extremely slow process. Trivial programs can take several minutes to compile using a traditional compiler, and complex designs can take hours or longer. 

Cascade is a novel solution to this problem, the world's first just-in-time compiler for Verilog. Cascade executes code immediately in a software simulator, and performs compilation in the background. When compilation is finished, the code is moved into hardware, and from the userâ€™s perspective it simply gets faster over time. Cascade's ability to move code back and forth between software and hardware also makes it the first platform to provide generic support for the execution of unsynthesizable Verilog from hardware. The effects are substantial. Cascade encourages more frequent compilation, reduces the time required for developers to produce working hardware designs, and transforms HDL development into something which closely resembes writing JavaScript or Python. It takes the first steps towards bridging the gap between programming software and programming hardware.

Dependencies
=====
Cascade should build successfully on OSX and most Linux distributions. Third-party dependencies can be retrieved from the command line using either ```apt-get``` (Ubuntu), ```opk``` (Angstrom), or ```port``` (OSX). Note that on most platforms, this will require administrator privileges.
```
*NIX $ sudo (apt-get|port) install ccache cmake flex bison ncurses
```

Building Cascade
=====
1. Clone this repository (make sure to use the ```--recursive``` flag)
```
*NIX $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/vmware/cascade cascade
```

2. Build the code (this process has been tested on OSX 10.12/10.14, Ubuntu 16.04, and Angstrom v2017.12)
```
*NIX $ cd cascade/
*NIX $ make
```
If the build didn't succeed (probably because you didn't use the ```--recursive``` flag) try starting over with a fresh clone of the repository.

3. Check that the build succeeded (all tests should pass)
```
*NIX $ make check
```

Using Cascade
=====

### The Basics

Start Cascade by typing
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade
```
This will place you in a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL). Code which is typed here is appended to the source of the (initially empty) top-level module and evaluated immediately. Try defining a wire. You'll see the text ```ITEM OK``` to indicate that a new module item was added to the top-level module.
```verilog
>>> wire x;
ITEM OK
```
The verilog specification requires that code inside of ```initial``` blocks is executed exactly once when a program begins execution. Because Cascade provides a dynamic environment, we generalize the specification as follows: Code inside of ```initial``` blocks is executed exactly once immediately after it is compiled. Try printing the value of the wire you just defined. 
```verilog
>>> initial $display(x);
ITEM OK 
>>> 0
```
Now try printing a variable which hasn't been defined.
```verilog
>>> initial $display(y);
*** Typechecker Error:
  > In final line of user input:
    Referenece to unresolved identifier: y
```
Anything you enter into the REPL is lexed, parsed, type-checked, and compiled. If any part of this process fails, Cascade will produce an error message and the remainder of your text will be ignored. If you type multiple statements, anything which compiles successfully before the error is encountered cannot be undone. Below, ```x``` and ```y``` are declared successfully, but the redeclaration of ```x``` produces an error.
```verilog
>>> wire x,y,x;
ITEM OK
ITEM OK
>>> *** Typechecker Error:
  > In final line of user input:
    A variable named x already appears in this scope.
    Previous declaration appears in previous user input.
>>> initial $display(y);
ITEM OK
>>> 0
```
You can declare and instantiate modules from the REPL as well. Be sure to note however, that  declarations will be type-checked in the global declaration scope. Variables which you may have declared in the top-level module will not be visible here. It isn't until a module is instantiated that it can access program state.
```verilog
>>> module Foo(
  input wire x,
  output wire y 
);
  assign y = x;
endmodule
DECL OK
>>> wire q,r;
ITEM OK
ITEM OK
>>> Foo f(q,r);
ITEM OK
```
If you don't want to type your entire program into the REPL you can use the include statement, where ```path/``` is assumed to be relative to your current working directory.
```verilog
>>> include path/to/file.v;
```
If you'd like to use additional search paths, you can start Cascade using the ```-I``` flag and provide a list of colon-separated alternatives. Cascade will try each of these paths as a prefix, in order, until it finds a match.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade -I path/to/dir1:path/to/dir2
```
Alternately, you can start Cascade with the ```-e``` flag and the name of a file to include.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade -e path/to/file.v
```
Finally, Cascade will stop running whenever a program invokes the ```$finish``` task.
```verilog
>>> initial $finish;
ITEM OK
Goodbye!
```
You can also force a shutdown by typing ```Ctrl-C``` or ```Ctrl-D```.
```verilog
>>> module Foo(); wir... I give up... arg... ^C
```

### Alternate UIs
If you're absolutely fixated on performance at all costs, you can deactivate the REPL by running Cascade in batch mode.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade --batch -e path/to/file.v
```

On the other hand, if you prefer a GUI, Cascade has a frontend which runs in the browser.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade --ui web
>>> Running server out of /Users/you/Desktop/cascade/bin/../src/ui/web/
>>> Server started on port 11111
```
```
*NIX $ (firefox|chrome|...) localhost:11111
```
If something on your machine is using port 11111, you can request that Cascade use a different port using the ```web-ui-port``` flag.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade --ui web --web-ui-port 22222
```

Environments
====

### Minimal Environment
By default, Cascade is started in a minimal environment. You can invoke this behavior explicitly using the ```--march``` flag.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade --march minimal
```
This environment declares the following module and instantiates it into the top-level module for you:
```verilog
module Clock(
  output wire val
);
endmodule

Clock clock;
```
This module represents the global clock. Its value flips between zero and one every cycle. Try typing the following (and remember that you can type Ctrl-C to quit):
```verilog
>>> always @(clock.val) $display(clock.val);
ITEM OK
0
1
0
1
...
```
This global clock can be used to implement sequential circuits, such as the barrel shifter shown below.
```verilog
>>> module BShift(
  input wire clk,
  output reg[7:0] val
);
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    val <= (val == 8'h80) ? 8'h01 : (val << 1);
  end
endmodule
DECL OK
>>> wire[7:0] x;
ITEM OK
>>> BShift bs(clock.val, x);
ITEM OK
```
Compared to a traditional compiler which assumes a fixed clock rate, Cascade's clock is *virtual*: the amount of time between ticks can vary over time, and is a function of both how large your program and is and how often and how much I/O it produces. This abstraction is the key mechanism by which Cascade is able to move programs between software and hardware without involving the user.  

### Software Backend
Up until this point the code we've looked at has been entirely compute-based. However most hardware programs involve the use of I/O peripherals. Before we get into real hardware, first try running Cascade's virtual software FPGA.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/sw_fpga
```
Cascade's virtual FPGA provides an ncurses GUI with four buttons, one reset, and eight leds. You can toggle the buttons using the ```1 2 3 4``` keys, toggle the reset using the ```r``` key, and shut down the virtual FPGA by typing ```q```. In order to write code which uses these peripherals, restart Cascade using the ```--march sw``` flag on the same machine as the virtual FPGA.
```
*NIX $ ./bin/cascade --march sw
```
Cascade will automatically detect the virtual FPGA and expose its peripherals as modules which are implicitly declared and instantiated in the top-level module:
```verilog
module Pad(
  output wire[3:0] val
);
endmodule
Pad pad();

module Reset(
  output wire val
);
endmodule
Reset reset();

module Led(
  output wire[7:0] val
);
endmodule
Led led();
```
Now try writing a simple program that connects the pads to the leds.
```verilog
>>> assign led.val = pad.val;
ITEM OK
```
Toggling the pads should now change the values of the leds for as long as Cascade is running.

### DE10 Backend
Cascade currently provides support for a single hardware backend: the [Terasic DE10 Nano SoC](de10-nano.terasic.com).
When Cascade is run on the DE10's ARM core, instead of mapping compute and leds to virtual components, it maps them directly onto a real FPGA. Try ssh'ing onto the ARM core, building Cascade, and starting it using the ```--march de10``` flag.
```
DE10 $ ./bin/cascade --march de10
```
Assuming Cascade is able to successfully connect to the FPGA fabric, you will be presented with the same environment as above. Try repeating the example and watch real buttons toggle real leds.

### FAQ

Q. flex fails during build with error related to ```yyin.rdbuf(std::cin.rdbuf())``` on OSX.
    
A. This is most likely due to the version of flex you are using. Some versions of port will install an older version. Try using the version of flex provided by XCode in ```/usr/bin/flex```.
